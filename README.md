# AI-Trading-Platform

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-based trading platform that leverages machine learning to predict stock price movements and automate trading decisions. The platform is built using a React frontend and will incorporate a Python-based backend for handling data processing and model execution.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django for API handling - TBD)
- **Data Processing and ML:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/Keras)
- **Database:** TBD (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB)
- **Version Control:** Git

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- Python 3.8+
- Virtualenv (recommended for Python dependency management)

### Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/ai-trading-platform.git
   cd ai-trading-platform

2. Set Up the Frontend
    Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:    
    cd frontend/my-app
    npm install
    npm start
    This will start the development server for the React application.

3. Set Up the Python Environment (Assuming use of virtualenv)
    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Running the Application
- Ensure both the frontend and the backend services are running. For now, the frontend can be accessed at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

### Current Status
- The frontend setup with React is complete, and basic components are rendering correctly.
- Next steps involve building the core machine learning model for stock price prediction and integrating it with the frontend.

### Contributing
